<h1>The best movies according to me</h1>
<h2>My all time fav 3 movies.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1.Kumbalangi Nights</h3>
<p>Kumbalangi Nights is such a aesthetic movie; the simplicity, the realness feel,<br>the genuineness of the characters, they are flawed, so real and relatable, the cinematography, the score, the highlight of the film would be Soubin Shabir and Fahad Fazil, the acting performance by them was a tapestry in perfection, the vibe of the entire movie give me chills and made me leave the theater with a smile.</p>
<h3>2.Vettam</h3>
<p>This movie is definitely a must watch, the scenery and the plot just blends nicely.<br> The songs are just superb and even after all these years this movie is one to definitely watch again and again.</p>
<h3>3.Bombay</h3>
<p>A Muslim woman and a Hindu man fall in love and elope to get married as their families object to their relationship. However, when they move to Bombay, they end up facing the wrath of communal riots.</p>
